## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Click on the sign in link to be redirected to the login form and fill in the respective details.

### My Process

I used some inspiration to create a simple sign up page which is linked to a login form that looks pretty much the same. I am having some trouble with responsiveness seeing as the heights arent exactly aligned and I do not know how to make it work when rotated yet. If you can offer some pointers on how to switch views across multiple devices when rotated, please share them here. :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
